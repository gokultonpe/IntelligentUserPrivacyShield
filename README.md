# IntelligentUserPrivacyShield
This is a pet project I created to protect User Privacy information from being displayed on the screen thereby preventing screen recording applications from recording sensitive data such as credit cards, passwords, etc.
The OCR codebase is from Windows universal samples OCR : https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples
I have added the logic to protect User Privacy or any custom user defined data that needs to be protected. 
Currenlty this feature works only on still images but has a lot of potential if integrated into live media content thereby protecting privacy. 
Comments and contributions welcome! :)
